  <!-- ABOUT ME CARD -->
  <div class="info-card">
    <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>

    <p>
      I first got into <strong>CSGO</strong> around 2018, and it quickly became the game I
      committed myself to for the next five to six years. I originally mained the AWP before
      transitioning into rifling as my playstyle evolved and competition intensified.
    </p>

    <p>
      Around <strong>2022–2023</strong>, I shifted into <strong>Valorant</strong> as the scene
      grew. While I enjoy exploring many game genres, <strong>FPS titles have always been my
      passion and strength</strong>. I love the fast-paced mechanics, strategic depth, and
      rewarding skill expression that define them.
    </p>

    <p>
      That same passion inspired me to build this <strong>Esports Stats Tracker</strong>. This app represents a tool
      to display match and player performance data cleanly and meaningfully for the games I care
      about most.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the future, I plan to expand this into a full <strong>fantasy esports platform</strong>,
      similar to fantasy football but tailored for games like CSGO and Valorant.

  <!-- ABOUT THE APP CARD -->
  <div class="info-card">
    <h2 class="section-title">About the App</h2>

    <p>
      This application is designed to track professional match data across esports titles such as
      CSGO and Valorant. You can browse games, view players, explore match results, and analyze
      detailed player statistics through a clean, unified interface.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every page is connected using an intuitive navigation bar, allowing quick access to:
    </p>

    <ul class="item-list">
      <li><a href="{% url 'game_list' %}">All tracked games</a></li>
      <li><a href="{% url 'player_list' %}">Professional players</a></li>
      <li><a href="{% url 'match_list' %}">Match results</a></li>
      <li><a href="{% url 'fantasy_home' %}">Fantasy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The long-term goal is to allow users to <strong>draft teams, compete,
      score points based on player performance, and climb leaderboards</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is just the beginning, and the project will keep expanding with new features,
      improved UI, and richer esports data.
